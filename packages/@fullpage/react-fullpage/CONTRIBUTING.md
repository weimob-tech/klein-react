# Contributing

All contributions are welcome

Please note that all functionality is backed by [fullpage.js](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js) so new functionality must be built there first. This repo should remain as a react-wrapper that consolidates state + events.

Please open PRs against the `dev` branch, not `master`, this helps coordinate the release of this package with [fullpage.js](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js)
